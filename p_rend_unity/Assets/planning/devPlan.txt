• Rough slice (Area A, Area B, basic representations of the mechanical components)
	• Best to start with the main loop (move through Render Path, find additional Render Path shots,
		use when looking at target(target heighlighted when sufficiently close),
		all render paths must be directed towards a target to win
• Iterate
	• Tweak mechanics
	• Associate objects with the mechanical components
	• Improve style
• Once playable(preferably with at least the initial render aesthetic in place), get people to playtest it
